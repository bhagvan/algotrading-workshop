# Financial Data and Algorithmic Trading Workshop

In the *first part* of the workshop participants will learn how to effectively ingest, catalog, and integrity check financial data across structured and unstructured proprietary data sets and how to subscribe to data from [AWS Data Exchange](https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/).

In the *second part* you will learn how to develop and backtest algorithmic trading strategies and how to train machine learning models for algorithmic trading with [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

Both parts are independent and you can choose to do both parts or focus on one of them.
