# Build and backtest trading strategies using Amazon SageMaker

**Time to complete:** 25 minutes.

## What are we building?

In this module, we backtest different trading strategies with Amazon SageMaker.

### Step 1: Backtest traditional trend following strategy (ca. 15 min) 

1. You can choose between the following Jupyter Notebooks: <b>Strategy SMA</b> or <b>Strategy Breakout</b> in the folder <b>2_Strategies</b> and run it from your Amazon SageMaker Notebook instance. In the instructions of the notebook, there is guidance on how to optimize the strategies.

### Step 2: Train machine-learning model for trading strategy (ca. 5 min)

1. Select the Jupyter Notebook <b>Train_Model_Forecast</b> in the folder <b>3_Models</b> and run it from your Amazon SageMaker Notebook instance. In the instructions, there is guidance on how to optimize the model.

### Step 3: Backtest machine-learning based strategy (ca. 5 min)

1. Select the Jupyter Notebook <b>Strategy ML Forecast</b> in the folder <b>2_Strategies</b> and run it from your Amazon SageMaker Notebook instance. In the instructions, there is guidance on how to optimize the strategy.

## Next step:

We've completed the backtesting and you can clean up the resources in your account. [Cleanup](../5_Cleanup).
