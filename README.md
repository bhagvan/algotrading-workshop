_Time Commitment Expectations: This workshop was created to be completed in approximately 1 hours._

## Considerations for Each Role
As the team lead on this lean team of one, you'll need to wear multiple hats.  Below are some things we'll cover from the perspective of each role:
* Developer - You'll modify python script to update the traging strategies.
* Data Scientist - You'll need to load the data into your machine learning development environment.  Once loaded, you'll understand the data, use a machine learning algorithm to train the model and do predictions.
* Trader - You will use different trading strategies based on data to maximize Profit & Loss while attributing to Risk.
* Analyst - You will use data visualization and AI tools to analyze Reports and gain insights from data.

## Goals

At minimum, at the end of this workshop, you should have backtested several trading strategies using Amazon SageMaker and also trained machine learning models that are used in the trading strategies. You also get a basic understand how trading strategies using trend following and machine learning are developed with Python and can be optmized for better performance.
